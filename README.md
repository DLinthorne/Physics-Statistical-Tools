Analysis tools for physics computations and statistics

## `ROOT`Statistical/ML Methods

The following folders focus using CERN's `ROOT C++ toolkit to conduct statistical tests, simulations, and analysis:

- [bayesian_routines](bayesian_routines/) shows example macros and methods on bayesian comparisons of parameter,
estimation and confidence contours. A local P-value search is done on ATLAS Higgs Boson data.
- [central_limit_theorem](central_limit_theorem/) shows how the central limit theorem can be realized using simple
parametric distributions.
- [chi2_contours](chi2_contours/) Calculates the two dimensional contour intevals using the Neyman-Pearson convention.
